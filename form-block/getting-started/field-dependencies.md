# Field dependencies <Badge type="tip" text="Only in Form Block Pro" />

For each form element, you can define it as dependent on other fields. This way, it will be hidden unless all defined conditions are met. For example, you can hide a field “Phone number” unless someone has checked the field to “Request calling back”, since the phone number is not important unless the user wants to be called back.

When a form element is dependent on at least one other field, it will receive a red dotted outline in the editor.
