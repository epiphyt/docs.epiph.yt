# License

Make sure to add the license data you received after purchase of Form Block Pro in **Settings > Form Block > License** to be able to update the plugin. Use your email address you’ve registered on our site while making the purchase and the license key provided via email.

## License lost

If you cannot find your credentials anymore, you can find your licenses in [your customer account](https://epiph.yt/en/customer-account/licenses/). Alternatively, you can use the page [Lost License](https://epiph.yt/en/lost-license/), which will send you your credentials via email (if the entered email address is correct).
