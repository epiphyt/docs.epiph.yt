# Switch from Form Block to Form Block Pro

If you have already used our free plugin Form Block in your WordPress installation, you can just install Form Block Pro alongside. Since it extends the functionality of the free Form Block plugin, both plugins need to be installed and activated to work.

To receive updates for Form Block Pro, make sure to [define your license credentials](/form-block/license) according to the documentation.
