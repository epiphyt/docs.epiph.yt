# Form Block Pro and Form Block

With Form Block and Form Block Pro, you can create rich, extensive and accessible forms for your WordPress website directly within the block editor. This makes the process of creating a form much more enjoyable and similar to creating other types of blocks. While Form Block provides the most used features for (contact) forms, Form Block Pro extends it with a wide variety of additional features and customization options.
