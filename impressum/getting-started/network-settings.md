# Network settings

When enabled network-wide in a multisite instance (which is recommended), you can set default values in **Network > Settings > Impressum**. These values will be used if no other – more specific – data is set on a single site. This way you can automatically set identical data across your network, if desired.

Also, when network-wide enabled, you should manage your API and license data here.
