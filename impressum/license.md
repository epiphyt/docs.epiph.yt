# License

Make sure to add the license data you received after purchase of Impressum Plus in **Settings > Impressum > License** to be able to update the plugin. Use your email address you’ve registered on our site while making the purchase and the license key provided via email.

## `IMPRESSUM_PLUS_LICENSE_EMAIL` and `IMPRESSUM_PLUS_LICENSE_KEY`

Since version 2.10.0, you can define the constants `IMPRESSUM_PLUS_LICENSE_EMAIL` and `IMPRESSUM_PLUS_LICENSE_KEY` in your `wp-config.php` to manage the license credentials here.

## License lost

If you cannot find your credentials anymore, you can find your licenses in [your customer account](https://epiph.yt/en/customer-account/licenses/). Alternatively, you can use the page [Lost License](https://epiph.yt/en/lost-license/), which will send you your credentials via email (if the entered email address is correct).

## Data transfer for updates/license activation

While searching updates for Impressum Plus or while activating the license, requests to our severs will be sent. These contain the following data:

* The website URL
* The IP address of the server your WordPress is running on
* The WordPress version

At no time individually entered data of your imprint or other input will be sent to our server.
