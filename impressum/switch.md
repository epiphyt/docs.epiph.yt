# Switch from Impressum to Impressum Plus

If you have already used our free plugin Impressum in your WordPress installation, you don’t have to set most of the settings again, they will be applied automatically. However, we recommend to review all settings thoroughly and check for correctness.<br>
After activating Impressum Plus you can deactivate and delete Impressum, as it’s bundled within Impressum Plus anyways. However, if you want, you can also keep it as separate plugin.
