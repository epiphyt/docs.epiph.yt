## Installation through the backend

You can uploaded the downloaded `.zip` file directly in your WordPress backend. You will need a user account with administrator permissions (or super administrator permissions in multisite installations).

## Installation through FTP

To install the downloaded `.zip` file through (S)FTP, you first need to extract it and upload the files and folders with an FTP program of your choice onto your website.  
After the upload, they should be found in `wp-content/plugins/embed-privacy`.
